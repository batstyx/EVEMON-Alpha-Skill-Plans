These plans are based on characters generated for each race using the Blank Character Generator tool in EVEMon and then populated using the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zSAmxqlqyWjPNxgfadJD8gSIwDFw58i6bPD7NA7AwIU/) generated from the [dev blog](https://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/introducing-clone-states-and-the-future-of-access-to-eve-online/) (via [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/50ikm5/spreadsheet_alphaclone_skills/)).

Skills are ordered by group and then alphabetically excepting prerequisites.
